# Image Card Expansion Project

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that creates a gallery of image cards. When you hover over an image card, it smoothly expands to provide a closer view of the image. The expansion effect is achieved using CSS transitions with a duration of 0.7 seconds.

## Project Features

- A gallery of image cards, each displaying an image.
- Smooth expansion of the image card on hover.
- A transition effect with a duration of 0.7 seconds for a visually pleasing experience.

## How It Works

- The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`).
- Each image card is created as an HTML element, and the image is displayed within it.
- CSS styles are applied to each card to define the initial size and styling.
- A hover effect is added in the CSS to increase the size of the card when the user hovers over it, creating the expansion effect.
- The transition property is set to control the animation speed and smoothness.
